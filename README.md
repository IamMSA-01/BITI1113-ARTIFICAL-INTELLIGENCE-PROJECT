##  B. ABSTRACT 
Everybody with admittance to news has heard the term AI previously. With the quick expansion in the utilization of technologies in the public arena and the improvement of the business, the requirement for innovations competent to survey the necessities of a possible client and pick the most proper answer for them is expanding significantly. Human emotion recognition is especially significant in territories like mechanical technology, promoting, schooling, and media outlets. In the event that somebody showed you an image of an individual and requested that you think about the thing they're feeling, odds are you'd have a very smart thought about it. Consider the possibility that your PC could do likewise. Imagine a scenario in which it could turn out to be shockingly better than you are. It appears to be a ludicrous idea, correct? Either as how it's assisting researchers with bettering oversee and break down their information or how it's as far as anyone knows going to assume control over the world and oppress the entirety of humankind.

## C.  DATASET

In this project, we’ll discuss our human emotion, detailing how our computer vision/deep learning pipeline will be implemented.

From there, we’ll review the dataset we’ll be using to train our custom emotion detector.

we’ll then show you how to implement a Python script to train an emotion detector on our dataset.

We’ll use this Python script to train a emotion detector and review the results.

Given the trained human emotion detector, we’ll proceed to implement two more additional Python scripts used to:
